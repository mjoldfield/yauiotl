# Yet Another Useless IoT Light

![The Light](http://mjoldfield.com/atelier/2017/05/yauiotl-case.jpg)

These are the source files for an AWS IoT based light I built.

You can read more about it on [my website](http://mjoldfield.com/atelier/2017/05/yauiotl.html).

## Repo layout

* case : Haskell code to produce PDFs for the laser-cutter, plus pre-rendered PDFs.

* code : Python code for the main application.

* device-tree : Overlay files for the input devices.

* systemd : Boot scripts.

## Caveats

This is more a brain dump than proper instructions. Itâ€™s probably worth contacting
me before using any of this.
