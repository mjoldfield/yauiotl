This is the python source for the AWS IoT Lamp application.

Typically you'll run it from this directory, having set up
a directory full of AWS credentials somewhere.

For example:

   $ bin/toy-light.py credential_dir/ --hasLED

or

   $ bin/toy-light.py credential_dir/

if this the remote control.

GENERAL NOTES

This has not been properly packaged, so in the unlikely event that
you actually want to build it, please contact me if you're having
any problems. 

CREDENTIALS

These typically have names like this:

  $ ls 
  config.json
  rootCA.pem
  start.sh
  toy-light.cert.pem
  toy-light.private.key
  toy-light.public.key
  
the names are globbed (see lib/awsiot.py for details) so thereâ€™s
some latitude.

Most of the files come from the AWS control panel, but config.json
is a local thing. A minimal example is:

  {
      "host": "xxxxxxxxxxxx.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
  }

where the host would actually reflect the real device.

DEPENDENCIES

There are some but I've not documented them. You'll need at least:

   - the AWS IoT SDK
   - evdev
   - pigpio
